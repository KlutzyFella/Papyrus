A Gemini-wrapper that can parse pdfs and comment on them built in under a day. 
Built using Next.js(frontend and serverless functions/routes) and Supabase (Auth and SQL Database)

Deployed on Vercel at: https://papyrus-theta.vercel.app/auth
Known Issue: The pdf parsing doesn't work on the deployed website yet due to ESM compatibility and time constraints. 
However, it does work locally as can be seen in the video attached.
